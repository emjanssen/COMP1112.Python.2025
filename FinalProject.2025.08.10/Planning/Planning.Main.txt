Intro/problem statement: 
I worked as a program admin assistant for five years.
This project is a series of scripts I wish I'd knew how to write back then.
These scripts reflect my own experiences/arduous tasks, but basically any company is going to have comparable admin-level timesinks.
I've also made up a few new processes to practice what we've learned in class.
There are five process sections to this project:

1. Program Team List
2. Template: Meeting Agenda
3. Template: Memo From Director
4. Reminder Email Timer
5. Create Encrypted PDF
