Intro/problem statement: 
I worked as an admin assistant for six years (one in operations, five in program/project environments).
This project is a series of scripts I wish I'd knew how to write back then.
The scripts reflect my own experiences, but basically any company is going to have comparable admin-level timesinks.
There are five process sections to this project:

1. Program Team List
2. Template: Meeting Agenda
3. Template: Memo From Director
4. Reminder Email Timer
5. Encrypted PDF
