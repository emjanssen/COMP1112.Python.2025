Intro/problem statement: 
I was an admin assistant for six years. 
At one of those jobs, I manually maintained an excel file with details for the 170-ish people on our program team.
Purpose of this assignment: automate data entry into a similar excel file.
Premise: every time someone joins the team, they email the admin a table with their details, based on a specific template provided by the admin.
This wouldn't be official documentation from HR; it'd be something program-specific, with details relevant to the admin.
Application will read table data from email and input data to excel file.
Two code sections: 1. create initial excel file / 2. read table and input data

Modules Required: os, openpyxl, docx

// - - - Directory - - - //

1. Create directory
reference code (from lecture 7):

import os
if (os.path.exists("C:\\example\\subfolder\\test")==False):
os.makedirs("C:\\example\\subfolder\\test")
else:
// open existing file (or create file)

// - - - Initial Excel File - - - //

# Save the workbook to a file
wb.save("myworkbook.xlsx")

import openpyxl
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('example3.xlsx')
type(wb)

another_sheet = wb.active  # Get the active sheet.
>>> another_sheet

sheet = wb['Sheet1']  # Get a sheet from the workbook.

/ / / 

2. Create excel file rename sheet

from openpyxl import Workbook
# Create a workbook
wb = Workbook()

3. Get active sheet

# Get the active worksheet or create a new sheet
ws = wb.active

4. Rename the default sheet

ws.title = "MySheet"

5. Append row with column headings

append(iterable)
Appends a group of values at the bottom of the current sheet.
append([‘This is A1’, ‘This is B1’, ‘This is C1’]) 

will need 8 columns
- first name
- last name
- company
- department (if internal staff)
- supervisor
- start date
- end date (if applicable)
- allergies

6. Save file

# Save the workbook to a file
wb.save("myworkbook.xlsx")

7. Close file
