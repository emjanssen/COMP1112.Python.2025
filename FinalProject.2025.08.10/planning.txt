Intro/problem statement: 
I worked as an admin assistant for six years.
At one of those jobs, I manually maintained an excel file with details for the 170-ish people on our program team.
Purpose of this assignment: automate data entry relevant to that excel file.
Premise: every time someone joins the team, they email the admin their details, based on a specific template provided by the admin.
This wouldn't be official documentation from HR; it'd be something program-specific, with details relevant to the admin.

Template would be provided as an Excel file, and admin would ask team member to complete the excel file and return it.
Application will have code that can read the table data from the following mediums:
- Excel file
- Word doc
- Email in outlook
So it covers people who return the Excel file, people who copy the table into an email instead, and people who return it as a Word doc instead.
It will input the user data to a workbook, and output a couple specific reports/lists (for example, a list of food allergies).
Six code sections:
1. Create initial workbook
2. Read data from Excel File
3. Read data from email
4. Read data from Word doc
5. Input data into workbook
6. Output curated lists

Modules Required: os, openpyxl, docx, subprocess
import imaplib
import email
from email.header import decode_header
import webbrowser

// - - - - - Directory - - - - - //

1. Create directory
reference code (from lecture 7):

import os
if (os.path.exists("C:\\example\\subfolder\\test")==False):
os.makedirs("C:\\example\\subfolder\\test")
else:
// open existing file (or create file)

// - - - - - Initial Workbook - - - - - //

2. Create workbook

from openpyxl import Workbook
# Create a workbook
wb = Workbook()

3. Get active sheet

# Get active worksheet
ws = wb.active

4. Rename active sheet

ws.title = "MySheet"

5. Append a new row with column headings

append(iterable)
Appends a group of values at the bottom of the current sheet.
append([‘This is A1’, ‘This is B1’, ‘This is C1’]) 

# Assign values to cells
ws['A1'] = "Header 1"
ws['B1'] = "Header 2"

# You can also append rows to the end of the current data
ws.append([1, 2])
ws.append([3, 4])

ws.append("First Name", "Last Name", etc....)
ws.append("Frodo", "Baggins", etc...)
syntax will add a new row at the bottom with argument values

Data fields (i.e. eleven columns):

First Name	
Last Name	
Company	
Department (if you are an internal staff member)	
Supervisor	
Start date	
End date (if applicable) 	
Email	
Landline	
Mobile	
Allergies

example return text text:

Frodo
Baggins
The Green Dragon
Snack Delivery
Gandalf Mithrandir

1-453-567-2345
Gluten, dairy

6. Save workbook

# Save the workbook to a file
wb.save("myworkbook.xlsx")

7. Close workbook

sampleWorkbook.close()

// - - - Read From Word Doc - - - //

8. Open workbook

import openpyxl
wb = openpyxl.load_workbook('example3.xlsx')
type(wb)

9. Open doc file submitted by team member
uses windows default app for .docx (which is normally word)
don't have to know where word is installed

import subprocess

wordFilePath = r"C:\path\to\your\demo.docx"
subprocess.Popen(["start", "", wordFilePath], shell=True)

10. Get full text from doc

for reading from paragraphs (probably not going to use, but keeping for reference):
import docx 
doc = docx.Document("demo.docx")
fullText = []
for words in doc.paragraphs:
    fullText.append(words.text)

from reading from the second column of a table:
doc = docx.Document(docx_path)
col2_text = []
for table in doc.tables:
for row in table.rows:
if len(row.cells) >= 2:  # make sure there is a second column
col2_text.append(row.cells[1].text.strip())  # index 1 = second column
return col2_text

/* Read Excel File */

11. Get cell data

# Accessing range
cell_range = ws['A1:B2']
for row in cell_range:
    for cell in row:
        print(cell.value)

/* Read From Outlook Email */
